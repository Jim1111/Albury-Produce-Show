<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Albury is a small village located in the Surrey Hills and since 1947 it has had a Village Show. In 2009 there were 800 entries in the 200 classes.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>In 2009 and 2010, James Flint was asked to build a new website with an online database to store the entrants to the show (please note: not the actual tickets, just the entrants). James did not complete the project as envisaged, replacing the database with a Google Form and a Google Spreadsheet.</p>

<p>As part of my Foundation Degree, individual project, he wishes to go back to this project and using his new skill set, from his studies, look again at one of his major projects, with new ideas.</p>
